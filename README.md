## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
